<h2>I attended Madison public schools my entire life starting at Glenn Stephens Elementary School. I then went to Thomas Jefferson Middle School, which has now changed it's name to Ezekiel Gillespie Middle School. My highschool, Vel Phillips Memorial High School, also underwent a name change, previously being called James Madison Memorial High School. Before and during high school I participated in gymnastics and diving. I am now working on my bachelors degree in Information Science at UW Madison.</h2>
