<h2>I am a Freshman at UW Madison currently studying Information Science as my major and I work at the Bakke as a Member Services Assistant. I was born and raised in Madison, Wisconsin with my two older sisters named Ella (22) and Daine (24). Ella lives in Chicago and is currently working as a nanny and a server at a restaurant, and Daine is a nurse at UW Hospital. My mother, Darien, was a math teacher my whole life at a highschool, but a few years ago she switched to the Cirriculum Coordinator title. My father, Bill, used to be the Coordinator of Operations at the Shell before it closed, but he now is the Assistant Director of Ice Operations at the Bakke and he really likes it. My family has a dog named Wiley who is the sweetest dog ever. We got him from a rescue so we are unsure what breed he is or his age. We named him Wiley after Wile E. Cyote from Looney Tunes since when we first got him he was pretty scruffy and reminded us of him.  </h2>
